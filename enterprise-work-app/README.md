# WorkFlo: An Enterprise-Grade Project Management Frontend

A comprehensive and feature-rich frontend simulation of an enterprise-level project and task management application. This project was built from the ground up to showcase a modern, scalable, and professional React architecture using Redux for state management and Vite for a lightning-fast development experience.

## ‚ú® Core Features Explained

This application includes a wide array of features designed to simulate a real-world work management tool, with a clear separation of duties based on user roles.

### 1. User Authentication & Roles
A complete authentication system is implemented with three distinct user roles, each with specific permissions.
* **Login/Signup:** Secure forms with strong, schema-based validation for both login and signup. A role can be selected during signup.
* **Simulated JWT:** On successful authentication, a fake JWT (`accessToken`) is issued and stored to manage the user's session.
* **Roles:**
    * **Employee:** The standard user. Can manage projects and tasks but cannot see reports or manage other users.
    * **Manager:** Can do everything an Employee can, plus has access to the high-level **Reports & Analytics** page.
    * **Admin:** The superuser. Has full access to all features, including the exclusive **User Management** page.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The application uses a robust `ProtectedRoute` component to secure routes. UI elements like sidebar links are also conditionally rendered based on the logged-in user's role.

### 2. Interactive Dashboard
The dashboard provides a real-time overview of the entire workspace.
* **Dynamic Metrics:** Displays live counts of **Total Projects, Total Tasks, Completed Tasks, and Pending Tasks** derived from the application's state.
* **Activity & Notifications:** Includes a mock **Recent Activity Feed** and a summary of unread notifications from the real-time notification panel.

### 3. Full Project & Task Module
This is the core of the application, with full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality.
* **Kanban Board:** A fully interactive, drag-and-drop board for managing task status.
* **Task Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task includes:
    * **Task Types:** (Bug, Feature, Improvement)
    * **Priorities:** (Low, Medium, High)
    * **Due Dates** and **Assignees**
    * A functional **Comments** section
    * A simulated **File Attachments** system

### 4. Admin-Level User Management
A secure, admin-only section for managing the application's user base.
* **Full User CRUD:** Admins can create new users, edit existing user details (including their role), and delete users from the system.
* **Detailed View:** The page displays a table of all users with their **role, status (Active/Inactive), and last activity date**.

### 5. Reporting & Analytics
A protected page for Managers and Admins to visualize project data.
* **Dynamic Charts:** Renders a Pie Chart for "Tasks by Status" and a Bar Chart for "Tasks by Priority" using the `recharts` library.

### 6. Real-Time Notifications System
A complete frontend system to handle real-time updates.
* **Toast Alerts:** Pop-up notifications appear for all major actions (e.g., "Task created successfully!") using `react-toastify`.
* **Notification Panel:** A bell icon in the header shows a list of recent events, simulating a real-time connection.

### 7. User Settings
A dedicated page for users to manage their own accounts.
* **Profile & Password:** Functional forms for editing profile details and securely changing a password (with current password validation).
* **Dark/Light Theme:** A theme toggle that saves the user's preference to `localStorage`.
